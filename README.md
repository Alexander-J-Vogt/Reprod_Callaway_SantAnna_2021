# RReplication of Callaway &amp; Sant'Anna (2021)

The Econometrics Using R seminar focused on replicating the Difference-in-Differences with Multiple Period methodology developed by Callaway & Santâ€™Anna (2021), which provides a robust framework for estimating treatment effects with staggered adoption timelines. The project analyzed how policy interventions affect outcomes over time while accounting for variations in treatment timing across groups. To support this analysis, I scraped data from a PDF to extract key variables on county characteristics in the 2000 and integrated the information into an analysis-ready format. The seminar explored critical econometric concepts such as parallel trends, treatment effect heterogeneity, and event studies, offering insights into the dynamics of policy impacts. Moreover, I used information on employment by country from the Quarterly Workforce Indicator in order to analyse the effect of an increase in minimum wage on employment in the U.S. on county-year level.
